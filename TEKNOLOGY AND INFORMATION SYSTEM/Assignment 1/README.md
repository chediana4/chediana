Had an amazing experience attending the Oracle Talk by Encik Muhammad Asrul Muhammad Zain during the UTM Digital Open Day. the session provided valuable insight into the digital industry, especially on future career path and skills needed in the digital field.

After the talk, we had the chance to interview UTM Digital staff and walk around the booths to better understand their thechnologies and work culture.
