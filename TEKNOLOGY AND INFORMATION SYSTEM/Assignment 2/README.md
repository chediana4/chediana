Industry Talk on Computer Science and System Development was delivered by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib.

The session gave me a clearer picture that computer science is not only about writing code, but also about problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I learned that understanding the overall development process is just as important as technical skills, especially when working on real-world projects.

The talk also helped me realize the importance of planning, project management, and choosing the right development approach when building a system. It gave me better exposure to how industries manage projects, adapt to changes, and work as a team to deliver effective solutions.

Overall, this session broadened my perspective on the expectations of the industry and motivated me to improve my skills and prepare myself for future challenges in the field of computer science.
